The value $b$ captures the rate of decay of the recency weight. Low values flatten the relative importance weight. Default range is $b \in [0,5]$.

The value $c$ characterizes the skewness of the recency weight and its peak. A value close to zero indicates that recent episodes have higher weight than those starting late in the memory. Default range $c \in [0,1]$.
