Associated with the *timing* of the episode. Parameter $d$ can be adjusted based on the extent of the episode's overlap with a special period. The weight is monotone increasing with $d$. The functional form for the timing weight is:
    $$ w_3(n_k,m) = 1 - exp\\left(-d\\left(\\frac{\\tau_k}{n_k}\\right)\\right)$$
