To start generating episodes you need to:

* First, choose the type of episodes you want. Up-episodes correspond to consecutive observations above certain threshold. Down-episodes correspond to consecutive observations below certain threshold. 
* Second, enter a value for the threshold.
* Thirdly, enter a value for the minimum duration of each episode (by default it is 1). Minimum duration is minimum consecutive values above or below the threshold.
* Finally, choose if a special season should be considered. This means that the episodes overlap with a special season will be taken into account when computing the index. If yes, you will have to provide a day and month for the start and end of the special season.
